This projects aims to implement a DSM based system for the Cell Broadband Engine.

The finished DSM system enables the use of a single Cell BE machine, as if it had DSM. The same system can then be used for a cluster of interconnected Cell BE systems.

This project contains code and partial documentation for our Masters Thesis.

We have now stabilized the code, and have put up version 1.0 of DSMCBE.
The code is tested with a variety of programs, and is found to be stable.
It has been tested on a 16 machine PS3 cluster through [Minimum Intrusion Grid](http://www.migrid.org).

[Version 1.1 is now released](http://code.google.com/p/dsmcbe/downloads/list), and contains numerous speedup improvements, as well as the ability to better utilize the execution cores in a dual Cell Blade.

We have finished work on our master thesis (DSMCBE) and got our Master Degree in Computer Science. The master thesis report (written in danish) is available for download. We have written an article in English, which will be presented during "ISPDC 2009" in Lisbon Portugal. See http://www.ispdc.org for more information.
