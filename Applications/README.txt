This folder contains a number of applications that were produce to test
and showcase DSMCBE.

The following applications are test of DSMCBE:
LatencyMeasure - Test performance latency in DSM and DSMCBE
TestConsistency - Test of data consistency under heavy load
Testbench - A number of small unit tests

They show how DSMCBE works, but are probably not exiting for developers 
who just want to use DSMCBE.

The applications that show real DSMCBE usage are:
HelloWorld - Simple startup and usage example
Prototein - Folding of prototeins
Braintumor - Tumor radiation simulation
HeatEquation - Simulation of heat movement (SOR)
