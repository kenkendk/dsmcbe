= Introduction =
This page describes how you can build programs for the Cell BE platform, using DSMCBE.

= Pre-requisites =
Before you can start using DSMCBE, you must know how to write programs for the Cell Platform. This guide will not explain this. You can read [http://www-01.ibm.com/chips/techlib/techlib.nsf/techdocs/FC857AE550F7EB83872571A80061F788 this IBM guide], if you want to get started. 

When building Cell projects, you are usually building a PPU unit and an SPU unit. Although you can run cell programs (and DSMCBE programs) without an SPU unit, they will not give you high performance.

Due to requirements from the [http://www.migrid.org/ MiG project] DSMCBE requires [http://library.gnome.org/devel/glib/ GLib 2.14.6]. If you machine does not have that version of GLib installed, you can get it from [http://code.google.com/p/dsmcbe/source/browse/#svn/trunk/glib-ppc32/usr/lib the svn source].

= Linking and using DSMCBE =
Once you have a copy of DSMCBE, you should reference the header files. For the PPU unit, you must include dsmcbe_ppu.h, and for the SPU unit, you must include dsmcbe_spu.h.

When linking, the PPU must link to libdsmcbe_ppu.a and the SPU must link to libdsmcbe_spu.a.

A sample PPU compile command would be:
{{{
ppu-gcc -ldsmcbe_ppu -lthread-2.0 -lglib-2.0 file.c -o"Program"
}}}

A sample SPU compile command would be:
{{{
spu-gcc -ldsmcbe_spu file.c -o"SPU"
}}}
