This application simulates heat travel in a material.
This is an application of the type "Succesive Over Relaxation" (SOR).

You can run the program on a single machine with one of these commands:
./HeatEquationCSP <number of spu's> <number of spu threads>
./HeatEquationCSP <number of spu's> <number of spu threads> <image width> <image height> <virtual row size> <iterations>

The application will generate an image file with the name outfile-<iteration-number>.ppm
